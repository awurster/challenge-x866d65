# Water Jug Escape Room

# About This Challenge
This is a challenge created as a puzzle style CTF challenge based on the "Water Jug" problem. It was also famously used in Die Hard 3 (the one with Samuel L Jackson) :).

I wanted to use refresh on Github and coding concepts as well as test out some new AI-facilitated coding. I thought it would be cool to create some CTF challenges as a way to understand some of the concepts more deeply.

I hope you find it enjoyable!

# How it works
This is a JS-enabled terminal to simulate having a shell on a system. It helps give structure to the challenge and control over possibilities.

It offers some typical commands you might see in a stripped down shell env. There is one flag at the start, which you'll need to find the second flag. The second flag helps you unlock the door and escape from the room.

You can only escape the room if you enter the correct passcode on the keypad by the door.
