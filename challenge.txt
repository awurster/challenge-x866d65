        Water Jug Escape Room
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You find yourself trapped in a room with a water tap, two water jugs and a scale.

One jug holds exactly 5 liters, the other 3 liters. If you manage to place exactly 4 liters of water on the scale, you'll reveal the first flag.

The tap supplies unlimited water, but no measuring marks except the jugs themselves.

Figure out how to measure exactly 4 liters to reveal the first flag.

You can only escape the room if you enter the correct passcode on the keypad by the door.
