Welcome to the CTF Terminal Challenge!

To get started, try exploring your environment with commands like 'ls' and 'cat'.

You find yourself trapped in a room with a bomb and two water jugs. 

One holds exactly 5 liters, the other 3 liters. The bomb will only be defused if you place exactly 4 liters of water on the scale. You have unlimited water, but no measuring marks except the jugs themselves.

Can you figure out how to measure exactly 4 liters?
